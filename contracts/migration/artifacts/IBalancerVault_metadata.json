					"details": "Called by users to join a Pool, which transfers tokens from `sender` into the Pool's balance. This will trigger custom Pool behavior, which will typically grant something in return to `recipient` - often tokenized Pool shares. If the caller is not `sender`, it must be an authorized relayer for them. The `assets` and `maxAmountsIn` arrays must have the same length, and each entry indicates the maximum amount to send for each asset. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces these maximums. If joining a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to send ETH directly: the Vault will do the wrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same join. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is important for relayers). `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If sending ETH however, the array must be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be joined. If `fromInternalBalance` is true, the caller's Internal Balance will be preferred: ERC20 transfers will only be made for the difference between the requested amount and Internal Balance (if any). Note that ETH cannot be withdrawn from Internal Balance: attempting to do so will trigger a revert. This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onJoinPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number of Pool shares). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and passed directly to the Pool's contract, as is `recipient`. Emits a `PoolBalanceChanged` event."
